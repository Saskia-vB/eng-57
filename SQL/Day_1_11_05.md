# Day 1 - Introduction to Database

## Introduction to database
### What is a Database?
Database: is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways. It is a repository, a collection of data that we access through a tool, i.e. Azure Data Studio.

### Tables:
We must be able to structure tables to contain the right type of information so that we can query it.
  - columns are vertical and rows are horizontal
  - columns are attributes of a characteristic
  - rows are a set of attributes corresponding to one entrance that table describes
  - Database Management System (DBMS): to perform database functions of sorting, retrieving, etc.

### Types of Database:
- One-to-One, i.e. employee details - NHS details
- One-to-Many, i.e. customer details - purchase details
- Many-to-Many, i.e. students - course. A junction table is used to change a many-to-many relation to a one-to-many.

### Primary Key:
- uniquely identifies each record in the table
- constraints: must be unique, it must always have an entry it cannot be blank/null, it must never change
- type: simple or composite/compound

### Candidate Key:
- all keys that are eligible to become primary key

### Foreign Key:
- used to create solid relationships between Tables
- constraints: used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables

## Structured Query language

### Languages:
- Data Manipulation Language (DML): just concerned with data and nothing else.
    - select; insert; update; delete

- Data Definition Language (DDL): how your database is defined (table)
    - create; alter; drop; truncate (delete everything from the table)

- Data Control Language (DCL):
    - grant; revoke

- Transaction Control Language (TCL):
    - commit; rollback; savepoint

### Data Types:
- VARCHAR: adaptable to different lengths of characters, it's a variable character.
- CHAR or Character: fixed lengths, 50% faster than VARCHAR at retrieving data.
- INT: signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647.
- DATE or TIME or DATETIME
- Decimal or Numeric
- Binary
- Float: a floating point number.
- BIT: a bit-value type. The number of bits per value is specified in size. The size parameter can hold a value from 1 to 64. The default value for size is 1.
