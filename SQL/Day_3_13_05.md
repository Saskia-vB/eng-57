# DAY 3 - Querying (SORTING, JOINS)


```SQL

SELECT o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity AS "Gross Total"
FROM [Order Details] o

SELECT o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount, o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity*(1-o.Discount) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o

- ORDER BY: sort your table, it is by default in ascending order so you need to mention DESC to have a descending order.

SELECT o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity*(1-o.Discount) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
ORDER BY "Net Total" DESC

Difference with GROUP BY - it groups everything:

SELECT o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
SUM(o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity) AS "Gross Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
GROUP BY o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount
ORDER BY "Gross Total" DESC


SELECT o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
COUNT (o.OrderID) AS "Number of duplicate ORDER ID",
SUM(o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity) AS "Gross Total",
SUM(o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity*(1-o.Discount)) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
GROUP BY o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount
ORDER BY "Gross Total" DESC


Use ORDER BY to identify the two highest Net Total in the Order Details table:

SELECT TOP 2 o.OrderID,
(o.UnitPrice * o.Quantity * (1-o.Discount)) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
ORDER BY "Net Total" DESC

String functions
SELECT c.PostalCode AS "Post Code",
LEFT(c.PostalCode, CHARINDEX(' ',c.PostalCode)-1) AS "Post Code Region",
CHARINDEX(' ', c.PostalCode) AS "Space Found", c.Country
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.Country='UK'
```
The WHERE clause does not recognise apostrophes as a character within single quotes, for a single quote use two single quotes to "escape" it.
```SQL
SELECT p.ProductName
FROM Products p
WHERE p.ProductName LIKE '%''%'

Using CHARINDEX:
SELECT p.ProductName
FROM Products p
WHERE CHARINDEX('''',p.ProductName)>0

## DATE FUNCTIONS:
SELECT e.FirstName+' '+e.LastName AS "Name",
DATEDIFF(yyyy, e.BirthDate,GETDATE()) AS "Age"
FROM Employees e

- For precision:
SELECT e.FirstName+' '+e.LastName AS "Name",
DATEDIFF(dd, e.BirthDate,GETDATE())/365.25 AS "Age"
FROM Employees e

SELECT CASE
SELECT CASE
WHEN DATEDIFF(d, o.OrderDate, o.ShippedDate)<10 THEN 'On Time'
ELSE 'Overdue'
END AS "Status"
FROM Orders o


SELECT DATEDIFF(yyyy,BirthDate,GETDATE()) AS "Age",
CASE
WHEN DATEDIFF(yyyy,BirthDate,GETDATE())>65
THEN 'Retired'
WHEN DATEDIFF(yyyy,BirthDate,GETDATE())>60
THEN 'Retirement Due'
ELSE 'More than 5 years to go'
END AS "Retirement Status"
FROM Employees;
```
## Aggregate Functions
```SQL
SELECT SUM(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Total on Order",
AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Avg on Order",
MIN(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Min On Order",
MAX(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Max on Order"
FROM Products p

SELECT p.CategoryID,
AVG(p.ReorderLevel) AS "Average Reorder Level"
FROM Products p
GROUP BY p.CategoryID


SELECT TOP 1 p.CategoryID,
AVG(p.ReorderLevel) AS "Average Reorder Level"
FROM Products p
GROUP BY p.CategoryID ORDER BY "Average Reorder Level" DESC

SELECT p.CategoryID,
AVG(p.ReorderLevel) AS "Average Reorder Level"
FROM Products p
GROUP BY p.CategoryID


SELECT p.SupplierID,
SUM(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Total On Order",
AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Avg On order"
FROM Products p
GROUP BY p.SupplierID
HAVING AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder)>5
ORDER BY "Total On Order"
```
## JOINS
```SQL
- Inner Join:
SELECT p.SupplierID,s.CompanyName AS "Supplier Name",
AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Average UNITS on Orders"
FROM Products p INNER JOIN Suppliers s
ON p.SupplierID=s.SupplierID
GROUP BY p.SupplierID, s.CompanyName


SELECT p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice, s.CompanyName AS "Supplier",
c.CategoryName AS "Category"
FROM Products p
INNER JOIN Suppliers s ON p.SupplierID=s.SupplierID
INNER JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryID=c.CategoryID

SELECT o.OrderID,o.OrderDate, o.Freight,
e.FirstName+' '+e.LastName AS "Employee Name",
c.CompanyName
FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID=c.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID=e.EmployeeID
