# DAY 3 - Querying (SORTING, JOINS)

## Maths
- Modulo (%) is the remainder, i.e. 12%5=2 because the remainder of 12 divided by 5 is 2.
- Brackets, Other-indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Substraction (BODMAS)
- Gross total: unit price x quantity
```SQL
SELECT o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity AS "Gross Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
```
- Net total: unit price x quantity x (1-discount) [if not decimal 1 - discount/100]
```SQL
SELECT o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount, o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity*(1-o.Discount) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
```

## ORDER BY
- sorting
- ascending by default, mention DESC for descending
- SELECT TOP (x): to select the top rows

```SQL
SELECT o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity*(1-o.Discount) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
ORDER BY "Net Total" DESC

SELECT TOP 2 o.OrderID,
(o.UnitPrice * o.Quantity * (1-o.Discount)) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
ORDER BY "Net Total" DESC
```
- the difference between ORDER BY and GROUP BY:
```SQL
SELECT o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
SUM(o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity) AS "Gross Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
GROUP BY o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount
ORDER BY "Gross Total" DESC


SELECT o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount,
COUNT (o.OrderID) AS "Number of duplicate ORDER ID",
SUM(o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity) AS "Gross Total",
SUM(o.UnitPrice*o.Quantity*(1-o.Discount)) AS "Net Total"
FROM [Order Details] o
GROUP BY o.OrderID, o.UnitPrice, o.Quantity, o.Discount
ORDER BY "Gross Total" DESC
```

## STRING FUNCTIONS
String functions are to manipulate text in varous ways in the SELECT clause.
- SUBSTRING (expression, start, length)
- CHARINDEX ('a','text') : giving you an index, which in SQL starts at 1 i.e. CHARINDEX('k','Saskia') result is 4.
- LEFT OR RIGHT: LEFT (name, 5)
- LTRIM or RTRIM: to remove spaces at the beginning or end of a string.
- LEN(name): length of name
- REPLACE (name, ' ', ' ') to replace spaces with underscores.
- UPPER OR LOWER: to convert to upper or lower case.

```SQL
SELECT c.PostalCode AS "Post Code",
LEFT(c.PostalCode, CHARINDEX(' ',c.PostalCode)-1) AS "Post Code Region",
CHARINDEX(' ', c.PostalCode) AS "Space Found", c.Country
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.Country='UK'

SELECT p.ProductName
FROM Products p
WHERE CHARINDEX('''',p.ProductName)>0
```
The WHERE clause does not recognise apostrophes as a character within single quotes, for a single quote use two single quotes to "escape" it.

```SQL
SELECT p.ProductName
FROM Products p
WHERE p.ProductName LIKE '%''%'
```

## DATE FUNCTIONS
Date functions can be used to manipulate dates in various ways in the SELECT clause.
- GETDATE: SELECT GETDATE()
- SYSDATETIME: SELECT SYSDATETIME ()
- DATEADD (d,s,OrderDate) AS "Due Date"
- DATEDIFF (d, OrderDate, ShippedDate) AS "Ship Time" to calculate difference between dates
- YEAR: SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS "OrderYear"
- MONTH: SELECT MONTH ()
- DAY: SELECT DAY ()

```SQL
SELECT e.FirstName+' '+e.LastName AS "Name",
DATEDIFF(yyyy, e.BirthDate,GETDATE()) AS "Age"
FROM Employees e

-- For precision:
SELECT e.FirstName+' '+e.LastName AS "Name",
DATEDIFF(dd, e.BirthDate,GETDATE())/365.25 AS "Age"
FROM Employees e

SELECT DATEDIFF(yyyy,BirthDate,GETDATE()) AS "Age",
CASE
WHEN DATEDIFF(yyyy,BirthDate,GETDATE())>65
THEN 'Retired'
WHEN DATEDIFF(yyyy,BirthDate,GETDATE())>60
THEN 'Retirement Due'
ELSE 'More than 5 years to go'
END AS "Retirement Status"
FROM Employees;
```
## SELECT CASE
```SQL
SELECT CASE
WHEN DATEDIFF(d, o.OrderDate, o.ShippedDate)<10 THEN 'On Time'
ELSE 'Overdue'
END AS "Status"
FROM Orders o
```

## Aggregate Functions
Aggregate functions are to be used to calculate tools usually in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause.
- SUM(OrderTotal)
- AVG(Unitprice)
- MIN(UnitPrice)
- MAX (UnitPrice)
- COUNT (*)

```SQL
SELECT SUM(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Total on Order",
AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Avg on Order",
MIN(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Min On Order",
MAX(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Max on Order"
FROM Products p

SELECT p.CategoryID,
AVG(p.ReorderLevel) AS "Average Reorder Level"
FROM Products p
GROUP BY p.CategoryID


SELECT TOP 1 p.CategoryID,
AVG(p.ReorderLevel) AS "Average Reorder Level"
FROM Products p
GROUP BY p.CategoryID ORDER BY "Average Reorder Level" DESC


SELECT p.SupplierID,
SUM(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Total On Order",
AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Avg On order"
FROM Products p
GROUP BY p.SupplierID
HAVING AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder)>5
ORDER BY "Total On Order"
```

## Logical Syntax sequence
- SELECT
- DISTINCT
- FROM
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ORDER BY

## Processing sequence
- FROM
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- SELECT
- DISTINCT
- ORDER BY

## JOIN
JOIN is a clause used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.
### INNER JOIN
- returns records that have matching values in both tables.
### LEFT JOIN
- returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the left.
### RIGHT JOIN:
- returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
### FULL JOIN:
- returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

```SQL
SELECT p.SupplierID,s.CompanyName AS "Supplier Name",
AVG(p.UnitsOnOrder) AS "Average UNITS on Orders"
FROM Products p INNER JOIN Suppliers s
ON p.SupplierID=s.SupplierID
GROUP BY p.SupplierID, s.CompanyName


SELECT p.ProductName, p.UnitPrice, s.CompanyName AS "Supplier",
c.CategoryName AS "Category"
FROM Products p
INNER JOIN Suppliers s ON p.SupplierID=s.SupplierID
INNER JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryID=c.CategoryID

SELECT o.OrderID,o.OrderDate, o.Freight,
e.FirstName+' '+e.LastName AS "Employee Name",
c.CompanyName
FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.CustomerID=c.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Employees e ON o.EmployeeID=e.EmployeeID

SELECT o.OrderID, CONVERT(varchar(10), o.OrderDate, 103)
AS "dd/MM/yyyy"
FROM Orders o


SELECT o.OrderID, FORMAT(o.OrderDate,'dd/MM/yyyy')
FROM Orders o
```
